*This project, I envision, will attend to how the musical compositions of these performances fashion narrativization through rhythm, tone, pitch, and drumming patterns. As well, I hope to engage how this approach to audio and fiction may facilitate a different way of comprehending the stories the talking drum performances tell (content), cultural meanings attributable to them, their implicit politics, and the ‘publicking’ that they engender. I’m also curious about the likely rhetoric of the audio medium, especially when I may need to reformat the performances from one medium to another (video to audio, for example) or one audio format to another.*  
Yoruba Talking Drum Fiction
This project attends to how the musical compositions of Peter Adedokun’s performances are examples of narrativizing with rhythm, tone, pitch, and drumming patterns in audio. As well, I hope to engage how this approach to audio and fiction may facilitate a different way of comprehending the stories the talking drum performances tell (content), cultural meanings attributable to them, their implicit politics, and the ‘publicking’ that they engender. I am also curious about the likely rhetoric of the audio medium, especially when audio recordings are formatted from one medium to another (video to audio, for example) or one audio format to another.  
Tools: Audacity, Google Spreadsheet, GitHub, MS Word, and AudiAnnotate.
Objectives:
To make musical narratives like Adedokun’s accessible to more audiences.
Approach this kind of work as fiction and demonstrate ways of studying it.
To understand the cultural logic of talking drum performances composition and mediation.
To initiate an inquiry into the media economy of African fictions, like Adedokun’s, produced or available as audio.
Methodology: 
Listening, annotating, and translating are the critical methods that shape this work. I employ an iterative practice of listening to the performances to recognize their legible aspects. This entail listening repeatedly to note the narrative segmentation of the performances and make connections between their metadiegetic and extradiegetic elements. Annotation involves describing with text some of the comprehended elements of the performances, while the translation work involves transcribing the content of the drumming performance from drum language to natural languages (in this case, from the Yoruba language that the drum mimics to English).

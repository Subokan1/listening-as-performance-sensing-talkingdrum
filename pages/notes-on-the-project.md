*This project, I envision, will attend to how the musical compositions of these performances fashion narrativization through rhythm, tone, pitch, and drumming patterns. As well, I hope to engage how this approach to audio and fiction may facilitate a different way of comprehending the stories the talking drum performances tell (content), cultural meanings attributable to them, their implicit politics, and the ‘publicking’ that they engender. I’m also curious about the likely rhetoric of the audio medium, especially when I may need to reformat the performances from one medium to another (video to audio, for example) or one audio format to another.*
